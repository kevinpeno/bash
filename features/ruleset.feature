Feature: Rulesets
A composition of rules may intentionally define a rule
As a Game designer
I need a way to define rules based on other rules

	# Scenario: Add a card
	# 	Given I created a deck
	# 		And I created a card
	# 	When I add the card to the deck
	# 	Then the deck should have a level equal to the level of all cards
