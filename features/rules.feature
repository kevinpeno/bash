Feature: Rules
In order to define functionality of the game
As a Game designer
I need a way to attach rules to game constructs

	# Scenario: Add a card
	# 	Given I created a deck
	# 		And I created a card
	# 	When I add the card to the deck
	# 	Then the deck should have a level equal to the level of all cards

	# Scenario: Remove a card
	# 	Given I created a deck
	# 		And I created a card
	# 		And I added the card to the deck
	# 	When I remove the card from the deck
	# 	Then the deck should have a level equal to the level of all cards
